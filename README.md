This repository conducts some quick and dirty data analytics on assignment scores from Columbia University's ORCA E2500 Foundations of Data Science class. I am a course assistant for this class.
I use metrics such as the size of jumps in assignment scores and the frequency of those jumps to determine what students experienced the most growth in the learning material. We compare the performance of the students who experienced this growth (growers) with other performance-based population in the class.

NOTE: For all commits, numeric outputs are not shown and student names are randomly generated for academic privacy reasons.
